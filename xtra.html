  <!-- <h1>Have a few different pages; when you click on an object it explodes and reveals a paragraph of text about cyberfeminism and the government -->
  <!-- clicking on that text will take you to a different page analyzing how cybberfeminism made a social change + an annotated bibliography citing the sources used</h1> -->

  <p>research javascript -> when an image is clicked, it first triggers a gif of the meat exploding, then using the
    marquee tag make the text bounce around; see if you can use javascript to increase the speeds at which
    they bounce / change the angle? scatter the paragraphs around the screen so that they look cluttered (check z-index
    if there are overlap issues);
    once all the meat is clicked / a certain variable threshold is passed (have it go up for every meat smash) trigger a
    "cutscene" of descending text all at once, at which point the screen
    has a shatter effect overlay and it "resets"; the user clicks through and....figure that part out -> have it
    redirect to a separate page where ressearch is presented in an artsy way alongside annotations? maybe use new art
    city to show a "3D" environment, but the lag might take a while
    ADD a hidden ting to both the images and the paragraphs; on clcik switch the linked paragraph to non-hidden and hide
    the image (see if you can do a single-nonlooping transparent gif? three seconds and then also hidden maybe)
    office cubicle? neat and tidy, not disorderly, looks very stifling; have tihngs that are obviously out of place;
    represents how these things are buried under the surface and waiting to escape

    THREE TYPES OF MARQUEE ANIMATION -- first do perfecly
  </p>

  <p>INLINE HTML</p>
  <a href="test.html"><img src="meat.jpg" height="50" width="50" onclick="this.remove()"></a> <!-- THIS METHOD JUST DELETES IT DIRECTLY-->
  
  <marquee><p hidden id="displayme">SCRIPT TAG</p></marquee>
  <img src="meat.jpg" height="50" width="50" id="hideme" onclick="hide('hideme')">
  <!-- THIS METHOD USES SCRIPT INSIDE HTML -->
  <p>SCRIPT.JS</p>
  <img src="meat.jpg" height="50" width="50" id="hideme2">
  <!-- TRY USING SCRIPT.JS -->

  <div class="message">
    <!-- <p>This is a paragraph! Here's how you make a link: <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a>.</p> -->

    <marquee>
      <p>THIS IS REASEASRHC</p>
    </marquee>
    <p> THIS IS MORE RESEARCH </p>

  </div>


  <script>
    function hide(obj) {
      console.log('fukc');

      var el = document.getElementById(obj);

      el.style.display = 'none';

      document.getElementById("displayme").style.display = 'block';

      // var sh = document.getElementById('displayme');
      // console.log('sh');
      // sh.style.display = 'none';


    }

  </script>
